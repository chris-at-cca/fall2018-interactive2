In the early days of the internet communications look much different than they do today. 

it was the Graphic User Interfaces, or GUI, which we’re accustomed to now that popularized and enabled most people to use computers.

Up until touch interfaces we primarily have interacted in computers using avatars to represent our actions – the mouse to click, a hand to drag, and all sorts of cursors to symbolize states – such as the hourglass showing the action was in the process of taking place.

metaphors proliferate. You can easily call up Mission Control for a global
view of your system or boot applications from a Launchpad; a robotic
Automator helps with routine tasks while a Time Machine transports you
to past versions of files.

With the popularization of touch interfaces we saw a layer of abstraction removed. Now computer users can interact directly with the objects on-screen rather than having the cursor intermediary. Similarly, the OS got simpler and more abstract. Gone was the desktop metaphor, and instead a grid of chicklets was the primary way to interface with the computer.

Take for instance the copy and paste interaction while using a computer. The action doesn’t discriminate between text or image, amount of data, or type of information. While it’s hard to say exactly how this impacts our perspective, it’s clear it changes our relationship to the information we interact with in a digital space.

				<p class="quote">In semiotic terms, the computer interface acts as a code which carries cultural messages in a variety of media. When you use the Internet, everything you access - texts, music, video, navigable spaces - passes through the interface of the browser and then, in its turn, the interface of the OS. In cultural communication, a code is rarely simply a neutral transport mechanism; usually it affects the messages transmitted with its help.</p>

We now see the computer and GUI as the intermediary for a major portion of our social interactions and relationships. Within this context it’s worth considering how the interface promotes or constrains certain interactions, perspectives, and relationships and to consider alternative modes of interaction.

Xanadu’s mission statement reads: 

'Today's popular software simulates paper… The World Wide Web (another imitation of paper) trivializes our original hypertext model with one-way ever-breaking links and no management of version or contents.'

While still not in popular use, as a gesture it gets at one of the many limitations of the models we’ve adopted.

so, as Giampietro mentions in his article, ‘I am a Handle’, if metaphors have suggestive use, one view is geared towards efficiency:

'Jobs’s metaphor is a comparison that emphasizes the efficiency of the two technologies for human advancement— recalling Taylor’s idea that objects don’t just allow actions but suggest them, the suggestive power of a bicycle is that of speed, progress, and the power of human beings to conquer boundaries.'

And those actions are precisely what Marcel Duchamp’s readymade
Bicycle Wheel from 1913 critiques.

Consisting of a single bicycle wheel turned upside-down and mounted
to stationary stool, it seems to celebrate—at least to some degree—
a pointless, going-round-in-circles kind of motion.

Duchamp himself frequently compared the wheel’s spinning to “flames
dancing in a fireplace” or the back-and-forth of a game of chess.
Rather than efficiency and progress, Duchamp’s wheel is a man-made
object that is somewhat accidental yet thoroughly intentional in its
design and offers no efficiency or practical use whatsoever.
However, in this refusal of efficiency, and in its willingness to break
from then-contemporary notions of art, it offers, in place of efficiency,
something akin to Kay’s magic eraser: an object that touts its virtual
delights over its real-world uses.

In this way, it is a different sort of bicycle for the mind—
one that it opens our collective imagination to new modes of aesthetic
interpretation
